# bwtool

bwtool is a command-line tool for manipulating bigWig files. It can be used to extract regions of interest, merge multiple bigWig files, and perform various operations on bigWig files.


first use in [trackplot](https://github.com/PoisonAlien/trackplot/blob/master/R/trackplot.R)


get software
```bash
docker pull polumechanos/bwtools:latest

ocker run -it -v  software/bwtool:/host polumechanos/bwtools bash

cp /software/bwtool/bwtool /host/bwtool
```

command

```bash
(base) ➜  bwtool git:(main) ✗ ./bwtool
bwtool 1.0 - Data operations on bigWig files
usage:
   bwtool command [additional command parameters]
commands:
   aggregate      (or "agg") produce plot data as an average of values around
                  the regions specified in a bed file
   chromgraph     roughly convert to the chromgraph format, suitable for UCSC's
                  Genome Graphs page
   distribution   (or "dist") produce plot data as the frequency of values seen
                  in the bigWig
   extract        (or "ex") extract data in some other ways than paste, matrix, or
                  window with a given bed, preserving strand directionality.
   fill           fill in regions of genome where no data exists with a value
   find           find regions of bigWig with given properties
   lift           project data from one genome assembly to another using a
                  liftOver file (can be lossy)
   matrix         extract same-sized sections from bigWig to examine as a matrix
   paste          output data from multiple bigWigs and align them one per column
                  in tab-delimited output meant to feed into computations
   remove         remove data equal to or thresholded on a given value
                  or remove data using ranges specified in a bed file
   roll           compute rolling means, etc
   sax            run symbolic aggregate approximation (SAX) algorithm on data
   shift          move data on the chromosome
   summary        provide some summary stats for each region in a bed file
   window         print out tiling windows of data in comma-separated lists

general options:
 -wigtype=<bg|fix|var>    output bedGraph, fixedStep, or variableStep wig
 -wig-only                for bigWig-creating programs, make a wig instead
 -regions=bed             use specific regions
 -condense                condense output, particularly bedGraphs
 -decimals=n              output specified number of decimals (default 2)
 -fill=val                some programs allow filling missing parts of the bigWig
                          with a specified value prior to using data.
 -pseudo=val              add a pseudo-count at every value
 -o=output.txt            where normally standard output is written, write to a
                          file instead.
 -tmp-dir=dir             by default, bigWig caching is done in /tmp/udcCache/*.
                          Override this by setting dir to the desired path.
