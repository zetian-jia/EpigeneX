# Welcome

Hello, and welcome to the informatics site for the Longo Lab! Computational documentation for the lab is hosted here, as well as the public facing code documentation for Longo Lab publications where available. Additionally, there are a few tutorials on some of the more general technical information that might not make it into a particular publication.

## Offical Longo Lab Website
This site is primarily focused on code documentation. Please check out the [Official Longo Lab Website](https://med.stanford.edu/longo-lab.html) for general information about the lab and publications.
